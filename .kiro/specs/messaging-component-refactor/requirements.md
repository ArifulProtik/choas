# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current messaging components (`chat-window.tsx` and `conversation-list.tsx`) have grown too large and contain multiple responsibilities, making them difficult to maintain, test, and understand. This refactoring will break these monolithic components into smaller, focused, reusable components that follow the single responsibility principle and improve code maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat window component to be broken into smaller, focused components, so that each component has a single responsibility and is easier to maintain and test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat window is rendered THEN it SHALL be composed of separate components for message items, chat input, typing indicators, and chat header
2. WHEN a message item is rendered THEN it SHALL be handled by a dedicated MessageItem component that manages message display logic
3. WHEN the chat input is rendered THEN it SHALL be handled by a dedicated ChatInput component that manages input state and typing indicators
4. WHEN typing indicators are shown THEN they SHALL be handled by a dedicated TypingIndicator component
5. WHEN the chat header is rendered THEN it SHALL be handled by a dedicated ChatHeader component that shows user info and status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the conversation list component to be broken into smaller, focused components, so that each component has a single responsibility and is easier to maintain and test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the conversation list is rendered THEN it SHALL be composed of separate components for conversation items, user search modal, and list sections
2. WHEN a conversation item is rendered THEN it SHALL be handled by a dedicated ConversationItem component that manages conversation display logic
3. WHEN the user search modal is shown THEN it SHALL be handled by a dedicated UserSearchModal component
4. WHEN the conversation list header is rendered THEN it SHALL be handled by a dedicated ConversationListHeader component

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared UI logic to be extracted into reusable utility components, so that code duplication is reduced and consistency is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user avatars are displayed THEN they SHALL use a shared UserAvatar component that handles avatar display with status indicators
2. WHEN user status is displayed THEN it SHALL use shared status utility functions
3. WHEN message previews are shown THEN they SHALL use a shared MessagePreview component
4. WHEN loading states are shown THEN they SHALL use a shared LoadingSpinner component

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored components to maintain the same functionality and appearance, so that the user experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the chat window SHALL maintain all existing functionality including message sending, typing indicators, and status display
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the conversation list SHALL maintain all existing functionality including conversation selection, search, and user status display
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the visual appearance SHALL remain identical to the current implementation
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing props and state management SHALL continue to work as expected

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new component structure to follow React best practices, so that the code is maintainable and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow the single responsibility principle
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL have clear, typed interfaces using TypeScript
3. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be properly organized in logical file structures
4. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL use proper React patterns for state management and prop passing
5. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL remove unused imports and variables to clean up the codebase
