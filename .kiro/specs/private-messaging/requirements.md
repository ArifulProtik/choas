# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables private one-on-one messaging and voice calling between authenticated users in the Discord-like platform. Users will be able to initiate private conversations, send real-time messages, and conduct voice calls with other platform members. The feature builds upon the existing authentication system and integrates with the current Go REST API backend and Next.js frontend.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user sends a friend request THEN the system SHALL notify the recipient and show pending status to the sender
3. WHEN a user receives a friend request THEN the system SHALL display the request with accept/decline options
4. WHEN a user accepts a friend request THEN the system SHALL establish a mutual friendship and enable messaging/calling
5. WHEN a user declines a friend request THEN the system SHALL remove the request without establishing friendship
6. WHEN a user removes a friend THEN the system SHALL end the friendship and disable messaging/calling between them

5. IF users are not friends THEN the system SHALL prevent conversation creation and show appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user in a private conversation, I want to send and receive messages in real-time, so that I can have fluid conversations with other users.
