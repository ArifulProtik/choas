# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables private one-on-one messaging and voice calling between authenticated users in the Discord-like platform. Users will be able to initiate private conversations, send real-time messages, and conduct voice calls with other platform members. The feature builds upon the existing authentication system and integrates with the current Go REST API backend and Next.js frontend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to search for and connect with other users, so that I can initiate private conversations with them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for another user by username THEN the system SHALL display matching users who are not blocked
2. WHEN a user selects another user to message THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve an existing private conversation
3. WHEN a user attempts to message a blocked user THEN the system SHALL prevent conversation creation and show appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user blocks another user THEN the system SHALL prevent future messages and calls from that user
5. WHEN a user unblocks another user THEN the system SHALL restore normal messaging capabilities
6. WHEN a user views their conversations THEN the system SHALL only display conversations with users who haven't blocked them
7. WHEN any authenticated user attempts to message another authenticated user THEN the system SHALL allow conversation creation without requiring a friend relationship

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to start a private conversation with another user, so that I can communicate privately outside of guild channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for users to message THEN the system SHALL display available users who are not blocked
2. WHEN a user selects another user to message THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve an existing private conversation
3. IF a private conversation already exists between two users THEN the system SHALL open the existing conversation
4. WHEN a user accesses their private conversations THEN the system SHALL display a list of all their active conversations ordered by most recent activity
5. WHEN a user creates a new conversation THEN the system SHALL validate both participants are authenticated users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user in a private conversation, I want to send and receive messages in real-time, so that I can have fluid conversations with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message and sends it THEN the system SHALL immediately display the message in the conversation
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL deliver the message to the recipient in real-time
3. WHEN a user receives a message THEN the system SHALL display a notification indicator if the conversation is not currently active
4. WHEN a user opens a conversation with unread messages THEN the system SHALL mark all messages as read
5. IF a message fails to send THEN the system SHALL show an error indicator and allow retry
6. WHEN a user is typing THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator to the other participant

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the online status of users I'm messaging, so that I know when they're available to respond.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a private conversation THEN the system SHALL display the online/offline status of the other participant
2. WHEN a user's status changes THEN the system SHALL update their status in real-time across all conversations
3. WHEN a user was last seen THEN the system SHALL display "last seen" timestamp for offline users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to initiate voice calls with friends I'm messaging, so that I can have real-time voice conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the call button in a private conversation THEN the system SHALL initiate a voice call request
2. WHEN a user receives a call request THEN the system SHALL display an incoming call notification with accept/decline options
3. WHEN a user accepts a call THEN the system SHALL establish a voice connection between both participants
4. WHEN a user declines a call THEN the system SHALL notify the caller that the call was declined
5. IF a user is already in a call THEN the system SHALL show busy status and decline new incoming calls
6. WHEN either participant ends the call THEN the system SHALL terminate the voice connection for both users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user in a voice call, I want to control my audio settings, so that I can manage my participation in the call.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in a voice call THEN the system SHALL provide mute/unmute controls
2. WHEN a user mutes themselves THEN the system SHALL stop transmitting their audio and show mute status to both participants
3. WHEN a user adjusts their volume THEN the system SHALL apply the volume change to the incoming audio
4. WHEN a user experiences connection issues THEN the system SHALL display connection quality indicators
5. WHEN call quality is poor THEN the system SHALL attempt to adjust audio quality automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my conversation history, so that I can reference previous messages and maintain context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a private conversation THEN the system SHALL load and display recent message history
2. WHEN a user scrolls up in a conversation THEN the system SHALL load older messages progressively
3. WHEN a user searches within a conversation THEN the system SHALL highlight matching messages
4. WHEN messages are loaded THEN the system SHALL display timestamps and delivery status for each message
5. IF message history is extensive THEN the system SHALL implement pagination to maintain performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my private conversations, so that I can organize and control my messaging experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to delete a conversation THEN the system SHALL remove the conversation from their view while preserving it for the other participant
2. WHEN a user wants to block another user THEN the system SHALL prevent future messages and calls from that user
3. WHEN a user is blocked THEN the system SHALL not deliver their messages or call requests to the blocking user
4. WHEN a user unblocks another user THEN the system SHALL restore normal messaging capabilities
5. WHEN a user archives a conversation THEN the system SHALL move it to an archived section while keeping message history

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications for private messages and calls, so that I don't miss important communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives a private message while the app is in background THEN the system SHALL send a push notification
2. WHEN a user receives an incoming call THEN the system SHALL display a prominent call notification
3. WHEN a user has unread messages THEN the system SHALL show a badge count on the conversations list
4. WHEN a user enables notification settings THEN the system SHALL respect their preferences for message and call notifications
